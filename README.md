The Lost and Found Management System presented in this project is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the process of tracking and managing lost items within a defined environment. This system aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for reporting lost items, matching them with found items, and facilitating their retrieval by rightful owners.

The system employs a user-centric approach, allowing users to easily report lost items through a structured interface, providing detailed descriptions and relevant information. Simultaneously, it enables individuals who find lost items to log their discoveries, creating a centralized repository for matching lost and found items.

Key features of the system include an intuitive user interface accessible, editing the data by admin only, removing the data, searching the item,
and a sophisticated matching algorithm to identify potential matches between reported lost and found items.

Furthermore, the system incorporates security measures to protect user data and maintain confidentiality, ensuring a trustworthy environment for both reporters and finders.

The language used for the above project is c++.
